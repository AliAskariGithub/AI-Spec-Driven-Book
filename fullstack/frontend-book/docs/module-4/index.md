# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of our robotics education platform! In this module, we'll explore Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that connect language, vision, and action in humanoid robots. Building on your knowledge of ROS 2 from Module 1, simulation from Module 2, and NVIDIA Isaac from Module 3, you'll learn how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs), speech recognition, and cognitive planning to create intelligent robotic systems that respond to natural language commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand Vision-Language-Action system architectures and their applications in robotics
- Integrate Large Language Models with robotic systems for natural language interaction
- Implement voice-to-action pipelines using speech recognition technology
- Create cognitive planning systems that map natural language to robot actions
- Design comprehensive task planning systems for humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Completed Module 2: The Digital Twin (simulation concepts)
- Completed Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac concepts)
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (topics, services, nodes, actions)
- Experience with simulation environments
- Familiarity with NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem
- Understanding of AI and machine learning concepts

## Module Structure

This module consists of three chapters that progressively build your understanding of VLA systems:

1. **VLA Fundamentals** - Understanding LLMs in robotics and Vision-Language-Action architectures
2. **Voice-to-Action** - Implementing speech commands with Whisper and intent generation
3. **Cognitive Planning & Capstone** - LLM-based task planning and mapping language to ROS 2 actions
