- **Research Projects**: Match lab configuration to project requirements
- **Capstone Projects**: Provide access to higher-tier equipment

### For Budget Considerations:
- **Under $10K**: Focus on simulation and basic hardware
- **$10K-$30K**: Proxy to miniature lab transition
- **$30K-$75K**: Miniature lab with simulation support
- **$75K+**: Premium lab or hybrid simulation/hardware approach

### For Space Limitations:
- **Small Spaces** (under 200 sq ft): Focus on compact robots and simulation
- **Medium Spaces** (200-600 sq ft): Miniature lab configuration
- **Large Spaces** (over 600 sq ft): Full hardware implementations possible

## Addressing Hardware Obsolescence in Lab Planning

### Long-term Technology Planning

- **Technology Evolution**: Account for rapid changes in robotics platforms and sensors
- **Software Support**: Ensure long-term availability of SDKs, drivers, and OS support
- **Standards Evolution**: Plan for changes in connectivity standards and interfaces

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Modular Architecture**: Design labs with replaceable components rather than monolithic systems
- **Standard Interfaces**: Use industry-standard connectors and communication protocols
- **Software Abstraction**: Implement middleware layers that reduce hardware dependencies
- **Phased Upgrades**: Plan for incremental hardware updates rather than complete overhauls
- **Vendor Diversification**: Avoid single-vendor dependencies that could lead to obsolescence risks
