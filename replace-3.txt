Create an interactive Test section for each chapter in Module 3 and Module 4

Context:
- Module 3: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 4: Perception Systems for Robots
- Each chapter already contains instructional content
- The Test section must be appended at the END of each chapter

Objective:
- Reinforce conceptual understanding immediately after each chapter
- Provide an active, learner-driven self-assessment experience

Test section name:
"Quick Test"

Test structure requirements:
- Total questions: 5 MCQs per chapter
- Only one question visible at a time
- User must select an option before proceeding
- A "Next" button advances to the next question
- After the final question, show the result on the SAME page

Interaction behavior:
- When a user selects an option:
  - The selected option becomes visually brighter / highlighted
  - All other options reduce opacity to 50%
- Selection state remains visible until moving to the next question
- No page reloads during the test flow

Result behavior:
- After the final question:
  - Display total score (e.g., 4 / 5)
  - Indicate which answers were correct or incorrect
  - Display a short feedback message:
    - Excellent understanding (5/5)
    - Good understanding (3–4/5)
    - Review recommended (0–2/5)

Question design rules:
- Questions must be directly derived from the chapter content
- Focus on conceptual clarity, not memorization
- Avoid ambiguous or trick questions
- Each question must include:
  - One correct answer
  - Three realistic distractors

Module-specific focus areas:

For Module 3 (Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity):
- Gazebo environment setup
- Physics simulation (gravity, collisions)
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Unity-based visualization and human–robot interaction

For Module 4 (Perception Systems for Robots):
- Camera models (RGB, depth, stereo)
- LiDAR fundamentals
- IMU data interpretation
- Sensor fusion concepts
- ROS 2 perception pipelines

Constraints:
- Format: Markdown / MDX (Docusaurus-compatible)
- Test section must remain inside each chapter file
- Do NOT create new chapters or separate quiz pages
- If a Quick Test already exists, upgrade it instead of rewriting

Success criteria:
- Every chapter in Module 3 and Module 4 ends with a Quick Test
- Learners can complete the test without leaving the page
- Visual feedback is immediate and clear
- Final score and understanding level are shown instantly
