# Quickstart Guide: Module 6 - Hardware Requirements & Lab Setup

## Getting Started with Hardware Planning

This quickstart guide provides a fast path for AI/CS students to understand and implement hardware planning for robotics labs based on Module 6 content.

## Step 1: Assess Your Current Compute Situation
1. Evaluate your existing workstation specifications
2. Compare against minimum and recommended requirements:
   - **Minimum**: 16GB RAM, quad-core CPU, entry-level GPU
   - **Recommended**: 32GB+ RAM, 6+ core CPU, modern GPU (RTX 30/40 series)
3. Determine if upgrades are needed before purchasing additional hardware

## Step 2: Identify Your Hardware Needs
1. Define your primary use case:
   - Simulation-heavy development
   - Physical robot prototyping
   - AI model training
   - Real-time processing
2. Based on use case, determine appropriate edge computing platform:
   - **Jetson Nano**: Entry-level, educational projects
   - **Jetson Xavier NX**: Mid-range performance for complex tasks
   - **Jetson Orin**: High-performance for advanced AI/robotics

## Step 3: Select Sensors and Input Devices
1. Identify required sensing capabilities:
   - Vision: RealSense cameras for depth perception
   - Audio: Quality microphones for voice interaction
   - Other: Touch, proximity, environmental sensors as needed
2. Consider compatibility with chosen edge computing platform

## Step 4: Choose Your Lab Configuration Tier
1. **Proxy Lab** (Budget: $500-$2,000):
   - Heavy simulation focus
   - Minimal physical hardware
   - Best for initial learning
2. **Miniature Lab** (Budget: $2,000-$8,000):
   - Basic physical hardware
   - Mixed simulation/physical work
   - Good for educational institutions
3. **Premium Lab** (Budget: $8,000+):
   - Full hardware implementations
   - Advanced research capabilities
   - Best for advanced projects

## Step 5: Decide on Implementation Strategy
1. **Simulation-First Approach**:
   - Develop and test in simulation first
   - Transfer to physical hardware
   - Lower risk, easier debugging
2. **Hardware-First Approach**:
   - Develop directly on physical hardware
   - More realistic testing
   - Higher risk but more authentic experience
